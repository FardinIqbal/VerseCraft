      content: "When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,\nAnd dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,\nThy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,\nWill be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:\nThen being asked, where all thy beauty lies,\nWhere all the treasure of thy lusty days;\nTo say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,\nWere an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.\nHow much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,\nIf thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine\nShall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'\nProving his beauty by succession thine!\n    This were to be new made when thou art old,\n    And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold."

      content: "Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest\nNow is the time that face should form another;\nWhose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,\nThou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.\nFor where is she so fair whose unear'd womb\nDisdains the tillage of thy husbandry?\nOr who is he so fond will be the tomb\nOf his self-love, to stop posterity?\nThou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee\nCalls back the lovely April of her prime;\nSo thou through windows of thine age shalt see,\nDespite of wrinkles, this thy golden time.\n    But if thou live, remember'd not to be,\n    Die single, and thine image dies with thee."

      number: 154,
      content: "The little Love-god lying once asleep\nLaid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,\nWhilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep\nCame tripping by; but in her maiden hand\nThe fairest votary took up that fire\nWhich many legions of true hearts had warm'd;\nAnd so the general of hot desire\nWas sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.\nThis brand she quenched in a cool well by,\nWhich from Love's fire took heat perpetual,\nGrowing a bath and healthful remedy\nFor men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,\n    Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,\n    Love's fire heats water, water cools not love."
